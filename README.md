# Harry-Potter-memory-game
This is my first vanilla JavaScript project. It's Harry Potter themed. I made it after just 2 months of coding. So it's not perfect. I'm sad 'cause I didn't make it responsive. So it doesn't really work on smaller laptops(but you can always zoom out your browser) üòÅ Maybe I will make it responsive, one day. I'm sorry 'cause I didn't put the files in separate folders.
I give credit to Code Sketch YouTube channel. I needed some help in the end.
